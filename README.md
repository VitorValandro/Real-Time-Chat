This was my first test using the socket.io package. The back-end was made using NodeJS with Express, the front-end using React and the socket.io to integrate both.

## About the project
I made this app on my winter vacation of 2020 based on the socket.io documentation (I already knew how to program with NodeJS and React) and some video tutorials. The project aimed to improve my skills with web aplications, NodeJS APIs, React interfaces and learn about web sockets and real-time connections. Think I achieved the expected result.

I've learned how to deploy applications using netlify (to front-end) and heroku (to back-end API) too. The result can be found [here](https://react-node-realtime-chat.netlify.app). To enter in a room type an username and the name of the room, then just start to chat!

### Project finished and closed
The application have simple features, but the purpose of the project was learn how to use web sockets to make real-time applications 
and not really making the new Telegram (but on second thought, it wouldn't be a bad idea).
